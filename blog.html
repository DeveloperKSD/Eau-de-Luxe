        <p>Choosing a perfume can feel overwhelming with the myriad of options available. Whether you're shopping for yourself or a loved one, finding that perfect fragrance can enhance your mood and leave a lasting impression. Here’s a simple guide to help you navigate the world of scents.</p>

        <h2>1. Understand Fragrance Families</h2>
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <p>Perfumes are generally categorized into families based on their dominant scent notes. Familiarizing yourself with these families can help narrow your choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img class="note-icon" src="Assets/flower.png" alt="Floral Icon"><strong>Floral</strong>: Romantic and feminine, floral scents feature notes like rose, jasmine, and peony.</li>
            <li><img class="note-icon" src="Assets/oriental.png" alt="Oriental Icon"><strong>Oriental</strong>: Exotic and warm, these fragrances often include spices, amber, and vanilla.</li>
            <li><img class="note-icon" src="Assets/woody.png" alt="Woody Icon"><strong>Woody</strong>: Earthy and rich, woody perfumes highlight notes such as sandalwood, cedar, and patchouli.</li>
            <li><img class="note-icon" src="Assets/citrus.png" alt="Fresh Icon"><strong>Fresh</strong>: Light and crisp, fresh fragrances can include citrus, green leaves, and aquatic notes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Consider the Occasion</h2>

        </div>
        <p>Think about when and where you plan to wear the perfume. Lighter, fresher scents are great for daytime wear or casual outings, while richer, more intense fragrances may be perfect for evening events or special occasions.</p>

        <h2>3. Test Before You Buy</h2>
        <p>Always try a fragrance before committing. When testing perfumes, spray a small amount on your wrist and let it sit for a few minutes. This allows the top notes to dissipate, revealing the heart and base notes that will linger throughout the day.</p>

        <h2>4. Trust Your Instincts</h2>
        <p>Fragrance is a personal experience, so trust your nose! Choose a scent that resonates with you and makes you feel confident. Don’t be swayed by trends or popular choices—your signature scent should reflect your personality.</p>

        <h2>5. Consider the Season</h2>
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <p>Different fragrances can suit different seasons. Light, airy scents are perfect for spring and summer, while warm, spiced fragrances work beautifully in fall and winter.</p>

        <h2>6. Look for Reviews</h2>
        <p>Research perfumes online before making a purchase. Reading reviews can provide insight into how the fragrance evolves over time and how others perceive it.</p>

        <h2>7. Layer Your Fragrance</h2>
        <p>To make your scent last longer, consider layering with body lotions or oils that have complementary notes. This can enhance the overall fragrance experience and keep you smelling great throughout the day.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Finding the right perfume is an exciting journey. By understanding fragrance families, considering the occasion, and trusting your instincts, you'll be well on your way to discovering a scent that feels uniquely yours. Happy scent shopping!</p>
